# Sign Language Chatbot

This project is a real-time **Sign Language Recognition System** that converts sign language gestures (A-Z, space, and delete) into text. The system uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and a custom-trained machine learning model to recognize each sign. It also integrates with the Google Generative AI to simulate a chatbot that responds to the text formed by the recognized sign language.

## Overview
The **Sign Language Chatbot** project aims to bridge the communication gap between people who use sign language and those who don’t understand it. It captures hand signs via webcam, predicts the corresponding letter using a machine learning model, and sends the complete text to a chatbot powered by Google Generative AI for interaction.

The model supports:
- Letters from **A** to **Z**
- Special gestures for **space** and **delete**

## Features
- **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe and predicts the corresponding letter using a trained model.
- **Confirmation Timer**: Ensures that signs are confirmed only after holding the gesture for a set duration (3 seconds for letters, 2 seconds for space and delete).
- **Chatbot Interaction**: Converts detected letters into a string and sends it to a chatbot API to generate meaningful responses.
- **Webcam Integration**: Live feed from the webcam processes the hand gestures in real-time.

## How It Works
1. **Sign Detection**: Using MediaPipe's Hand module, the hand landmarks are detected in real-time.
2. **Prediction**: These landmarks are fed into a pre-trained machine learning model that predicts the signed letter (A-Z, space, delete).
3. **Confirmation**: After confirming the same gesture for a specific time (3 seconds for letters, 2 seconds for space/delete), the letter is added to the sign string.
4. **Chatbot Response**: When the user stops signing for a defined period, the system sends the accumulated string to Google Generative AI, and the chatbot responds.

## Key Files

- **`model.p`**: This file contains the pre-trained model (loaded using Python's `pickle` module) that predicts the sign language gestures.
- **`main.py`**: The main file that initializes the webcam feed, processes hand landmarks, predicts the sign language gestures, and interacts with the Google Generative AI chatbot.
- **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists all the dependencies required to run the project. You can install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Collection

This project includes two files to help create a dataset of hand signs for training the sign language recognition model:

1. **collect_imgs.py**: This script captures real-time images of hand signs using the webcam. It allows you to manually collect images for each sign (A-Z, space, delete), which are then saved locally for further processing.

   **To run the image collection script**:
   ```bash
   python collect_imgs.py
Functionality:
Opens a webcam feed for real-time hand sign capture.
Allows you to manually label and save images for each sign gesture (A-Z, space, delete).
The images are saved in separate folders, each representing a specific sign.
Usage Scenario: Use this script to collect your own hand sign data for model training.

2. **create_dataset.py**: This script processes the collected hand sign images and creates a dataset by extracting landmarks (using MediaPipe) from the images. The processed dataset is saved as a pickle file for easy use during model training.

To run the dataset creation script:
```bash
  python create_dataset.py
```
Functionality:
Reads the images collected by collect_imgs.py.
Extracts hand landmarks from each image using MediaPipe.
Saves the processed data (landmarks and labels) into a pickle file (dataset.pkl), which can be used for training the machine learning model.
Usage Scenario: After collecting hand sign images, use this script to create the dataset by extracting features and storing them in a format ready for model training.


### Explanation:
- Each file is described with its purpose, command to run, functionality, and usage scenario.
- The workflow explains the sequential process of collecting images and then creating a dataset, giving users a clear understanding of how to use the scripts.


## Model Training

The model used in this project is trained to recognize 29 classes (A-Z, space, delete) using hand landmarks as input features. The training process involves:

- Capturing hand sign images.
- Extracting hand landmarks using **MediaPipe**.
- Training a machine learning model on these features to predict the sign.
  
**To run the Train_Model.py**:
   ```bash
   python Train_Model.py
  ```

## Model Inference

This project provides two separate inference scripts for testing the sign language recognition system:

1. **inference.py**: This script is used to test the sign language recognition model independently, without the chatbot. It captures real-time hand gestures, predicts the corresponding sign, and displays the predicted output.

   **To run the inference for sign language recognition**:
   ```bash
   python inference.py
Functionality: It opens a webcam feed, detects hand gestures using MediaPipe, and displays the recognized letter (A-Z, space, delete) in real-time.
Usage Scenario: Use this script if you're only interested in testing the sign recognition model without chatbot interaction.

2. **inference_with_chatbot.py**: This script tests the sign language recognition model integrated with the Google Generative AI chatbot. After detecting and recognizing a sign language sequence, the system sends the recognized string to the chatbot, which responds in real-time.

To run the inference with the chatbot:
```bash
   python inference_with_chatbot.py
```
Functionality: It opens a webcam feed, detects hand gestures, and predicts the corresponding sign. After forming a sentence, it sends the string to the Google Generative AI chatbot, which responds to the signed text.
Usage Scenario: Use this script when you want to test both sign language recognition and chatbot interaction in real-time.
Key Feature: Once a sentence is formed and confirmed, the chatbot responds after 5 seconds of inactivity.


### Explanation:
- Each file is described with its purpose, command to run, functionality, and appropriate use case.
- The differences between the two inference scripts are clearly highlighted, so users know which one to use based on their goals.


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- A **webcam** (for real-time gesture detection)
- A **Google Cloud account** with access to the Google Generative AI API (for chatbot interaction)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman-Ahmed-Samir/SignlanguageChatbot.git
    cd SignlanguageChatbot
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the Google Generative AI API by obtaining an API key and storing it in an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key'
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Setting Up API Keys

This project uses the Google Generative AI API to generate chatbot responses. To use this feature:

1. Sign up for **Google Cloud** and enable the **Generative AI API**.
2. Create an API key and store it in your environment variables as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
The Streamlit interface will open in your default web browser. Use the webcam feed to start signing letters (A-Z), "space," and "delete" gestures. After forming a sentence, wait for 5 seconds, and the system will send the string to the chatbot, which will respond in real time.

### Key Controls:

- **Sign a letter**: Hold the hand gesture for 3 seconds to confirm a letter.
- **Space/Delete**: Sign the space or delete gesture and hold for 2 seconds.
- **Chatbot response**: After 5 seconds of inactivity, the chatbot will respond to the signed text.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the real-time web application.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand landmark detection.
- **Google Generative AI**: For chatbot interaction.
- **OpenCV**: For handling webcam input and image processing.
